## What is CORDS?

[CORDS](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is COReset and Data Selection library for making machine learning time, energy, cost, and compute efficient. CORDS is built on top of PyTorch. Today, deep learning systems are extremely compute-intensive, with significant turnaround times, energy inefficiencies, higher costs, and resource requirements [1,2]. CORDS is an effort to make deep learning more energy, cost, resource, and time-efficient while not sacrificing accuracy. The following are the goals CORDS tries to achieve:

<p align="center"><i><b>Data Efficiency</b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Reducing End to End Training Time</b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Reducing Energy Requirement</b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Faster Hyper-parameter tuning </b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Reducing Resource (GPU) Requirement and Costs</b></i></p>

The primary purpose of CORDS is to select the suitable representative data subsets from massive datasets, and it does so iteratively. CORDS uses recent advances in data subset selection, particularly ideas of coresets and submodularity select such subsets. CORDS implements several state-of-the-art data subset/coreset selection algorithms for efficient supervised learning(SL) and semi-supervised learning(SSL). 

Some of the algorithms currently implemented with CORDS include:

For Efficient and Robust Supervised Learning:
- [GLISTER](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies/cords.selection_strategies.SL.html#module-cords.selectionstrategies.SL.glisterstrategy)
- [GradMatch](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies/cords.selection_strategies.SL.html#module-cords.selectionstrategies.SL.gradmatchstrategy)
- [CRAIG](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies/cords.selection_strategies.SL.html#module-cords.selectionstrategies.SL.craigstrategy)
- [SubmodularSelection](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies/cords.selection_strategies.SL.html#module-cords.selectionstrategies.SL.submodularselectionstrategy) (Facility Location, Feature Based Functions, Coverage, Diversity)
- [RandomSelection](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies/cords.selection_strategies.SL.html#module-cords.selectionstrategies.SL.randomstrategy)

For Efficient and Robust Semi-supervised Learning:

- [GradMatch](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies/cords.selection_strategies.SSL.html#module-cords.selectionstrategies.SSL.gradmatchstrategy)
- [CRAIG](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies/cords.selection_strategies.SSL.html#module-cords.selectionstrategies.SSL.craigstrategy)
- [RandomSelection](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies/cords.selection_strategies.SSL.html#module-cords.selectionstrategies.SL.randomstrategy)

We are continuously incorporating newer and better algorithms into CORDS. Some of the features of CORDS includes:

- Reproducibility of SOTA in Data Selection and Coresets: Enable easy reproducibility of SOTA described above. We are trying also to add more algorithms, so if you have an algorithm you would like us to include, please let us know,
- Benchmarking: We have benchmarked CORDS (and the algorithms present right now) on several datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, SVHN, and ImageNet. 
- Ease of Use: One of the main goals of CORDS is that it is easy to use and add to CORDS. Feel free to contribute to CORDS!
- Modular design: The data selection algorithms are directly incorporated into data loaders, allowing one to use their own training loop for varied utility scenarios. 
- A broad number of use cases: CORDS is currently implemented for simple image classification tasks and hyperparameter tuning, but we are working on integrating several additional use cases like  Auto-ML, object detection, speech recognition, semi-supervised learning, etc.

## Applications

### Efficient Hyper-parameter Optimization(HPO)
The subset selection strategies for efficient supervised learning in CORDS allow one to train models faster. We can use the faster model training using data subsets for quicker configuration evaluations in Hyper-parameter tuning. A detailed pipeline figure of efficient hyper-parameter tuning using subset based training for faster configuration evaluations can be seen below:

    </br>
</p>

We can use any existing data subset selection strategy in CORDS along with existing hyperparameter search and scheduling algorithms currently. 
We currently use [Ray-Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) library for hyper-parameter tuning and search algorithms.

Please find the tutorial notebook explaining the usage of CORDS subset selections strategies for Efficient Hyper-parameter optimization in the following [notebook](https://github.com/decile-team/cords/blob/main/examples/HPO/image_classification/python_notebooks/CORDS_SL_CIFAR10_HPO_ASHA_Example.ipynb)

## Highlights
- 3x to 5x speedups, cost reduction, and energy reductions in the training of deep models in supervised learning
- 3x+ speedups, cost/energy reduction for deep model training in semi-supervised learning
- 3x to 30x speedups and cost/energy reduction for Hyper-parameter tuning using subset selection with SOTA schedulers (Hyperband and ASHA) and algorithms (TPE, Random)

## Speedups achieved using CORDS
To achieve significantly faster speedups, one can use the subset selection data loaders from CORDS while keeping the training algorithm the same. Look at the speedups one can achieve using the subset selection data loaders from CORDS below:

## Starting with CORDS

### Pip Installation

To install the latest version of the CORDS package using PyPI:

    ```python
    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ cords
    ```

### From Git Repository
To install using the source:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/decile-team/cords.git
    cd cords
    pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
    ```

### First Steps

To better understand CORDS's functionality, we have provided example Jupyter notebooks and python code in the [examples](https://github.com/decile-team/cords/tree/main/examples) folder, which can be easily executed by using Google Colab. We also provide a simple SL, SSL, and HPO training loops that runs experiments using a provided configuration file. To run this loop, you can look into following code examples:

Using default supervised training loop,
```python
from train_sl import TrainClassifier
from cords.utils.config_utils import load_config_data

config_file = '/content/cords/configs/SL/config_glister_cifar10.py'
cfg = load_config_data(config_file)
clf = TrainClassifier(cfg)
clf.train()
```

Using default semi-supervised training loop,
```python
from train_ssl import TrainClassifier
from cords.utils.config_utils import load_config_data

config_file = '/content/cords/configs/SSL/config_retrieve-warm_vat_cifar10.py'
cfg = load_config_data(config_file)
clf = TrainClassifier(cfg)
clf.train()
```

<!-- Using default hyper-parameter optimization loop,
```python
from train_ssl import TrainClassifier
from cords.utils.config_utils import load_config_data

config_file = '/content/cords/configs/SSL/config_retrieve-warm_vat_cifar10.py'
cfg = load_config_data(config_file)
clf = TrainClassifier(cfg)
clf.train()
``` -->

You can use the default configurations that we have provided in the configs folder, or you can make a custom configuration. For making your custom configuration file for training, please refer to [CORDS Configuration File Documentation](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies/cords.configs.html).

## Acknowledgment
This library takes inspiration, builds upon, and uses pieces of code from several open source codebases. These include [Teppei Suzuki's consistency based SSL repository](https://github.com/perrying/pytorch-consistency-regularization) and [Richard Liaw's Tune repository](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/python/ray/tune).
