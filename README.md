## What is CORDS?

[CORDS](https://cords.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an efficient and scalable library for 
data efficient machine learning built on top of pytorch. 

<p align="center"><i><b>Data Efficient</b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Reduced Train Time</b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Scalable</b></i></p>

The primary purpose of CORDS is to select the right representative data subset from massive datasets. 
We use submodularity based data selection strategies to select such subsets.

CORDS implements a number of state of the art data subset selection algorithms 
and coreset algorithms. Some of the algorithms currently implemented with CORDS include:

- GLISTER [1]
- GradMatch [2]
- CRAIG [2,3]
- SubmodularSelection [4,5,6]
  - Facility Location
  - Feature Based Functions
  - Coverage
  - Diversity
- RandomSelection


## Installation

1. To install latest version of CORDS package using PyPI:

    ```python
    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ cords
    ```

2. To install using source:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/decile-team/cords.git
    cd cords
    pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
    ```



## Getting Started

Here are some [tutorials](https://github.com/decile-team/cords/tree/main/notebooks) to get you started with CORDS. 


## Benchmarking results

The below link contains the jupyter notebook link for cifar10 timing analysis experiments

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) CIFAR10 Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xT6sGmDGMz8XBDmOKs5cl1cipX0Ss1sh?usp=sharing)

Results for running the benchmark on the different datasets for each strategy with different budgets for 300 epochs. The accuracy and cumulative time are calculated after 200 epochs.
The following results in the table show that training data is reduced significantly compared to training with full dataset with very less reduction in accuracy.
