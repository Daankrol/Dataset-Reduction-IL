# CORDS: COResets and Data Subset selection
Reduce end to end training time from days to hours and hours to minutes using coresets and data selection. CORDS implements a number of state of the art data subset selection algorithms and coreset algorithms. Some of the algorithms currently implemented with CORDS include:

- GLISTER [1]
- GradMatchOMP [2]
- GradMatchFixed [2] 
- CRAIG [2,3]
- SubmodularSelection [4,5,6]
  - Facility Location
  - Feature Based Functions
  - Coverage
  - Diversity
- RandomSelection
